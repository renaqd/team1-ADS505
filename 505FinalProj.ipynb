    "Based on our sentiment analysis, this means that there is average sentiment for good and bad reviews. Essentially this means that there isn't extraordinary language used on the good reviews or bad. They are mild reviews in both cases.  The range is -1 bad sentiment to positive 1 good sentiment. Since the sentiment for bad reviews is .04 that means that even the bad reviews are leaning towards neutral rather than bad. "
